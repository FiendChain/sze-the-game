    "Hm? You might be asking, \"Well then, who/what are you, Narrator?\""

    "Think of me as another voice in the chorus of his collective unconscious and leave it at that, for now."
    "So just call me the Narrator."
    "Curiously, it seems that our Hero is somewhat aware of me, assuming that I am perhaps just a part of his own stream of consciousness."

    "It's complicated..."
    "Sure, I guess I am of Sze's thoughts. But are one's thoughts entirely one's own?"
    "What I mean is, you might be able to guide Sze to meet me. However, a word of warning; a meeting with me, or those of my kind"
    "is usually a sign of approaching calamity." 
    "So perhaps, you should consider forgo making Sze meet me"
    "and instead let me remain merely a figment of his imagination, narrating his path."

    "It is the first day of school and you do not look forward to another miserable year of Fort Street."

    "Fort Street High School..."
    "The oldest public high school on the continent, it gets its fair share of academically talented students through the Selective school test, along with the occasional transfer."
    "However, it is no longer as prestigious as it used to be; other schools have risen and overtaken the Fort in regards to academic ability."
    "Most notably, James Ruse Agricultural High School, which is now the Zeus of the pantheon of high schools."
    "As for yourself, you're just an average student in the Fort. Which, because it's academically selective, makes you a bit above average."
    "But don't flatter yourself; you aren't exactly stellar."
    "In fact, you're so average, you could almost be the star of {s}a visual novel{/s} a generic anime."
